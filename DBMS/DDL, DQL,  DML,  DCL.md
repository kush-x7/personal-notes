**Database Management System (DBMS) Notes: DDL, DQL, DCL, DML**

1. **DDL (Data Definition Language):**
    
    - **Definition:**
        - DDL is like the architect's blueprint. It helps define and structure the database.
    - **Easy Language:**
        - It's for creating, modifying, and deleting the structure of the database.
2. **Example:**
    
    - Creating tables, altering their structure, or dropping them.

**Keywords:**

- **CREATE:** Make something new (like creating a table).
- **ALTER:** Change the structure (like adding a new column to a table).
- **DROP:** Remove something (like deleting a table).

3. **DQL (Data Query Language):**
    
    - **Definition:**
        - DQL is like asking questions to get specific information from the database.
    - **Easy Language:**
        - It's for fetching or retrieving data.
4. **Example:**
    
    - Selecting all the names of students from a table.

**Keywords:**

- **SELECT:** Ask the database to show specific information.

5. **DCL (Data Control Language):**
    
    - **Definition:**
        - DCL is like the security guard. It controls who can access or manipulate the data.
    - **Easy Language:**
        - It's for managing permissions and access.
6. **Example:**
    
    - Granting or revoking permissions to users.

**Keywords:**

- **GRANT:** Give permission.
- **REVOKE:** Take back permission.

7. **DML (Data Manipulation Language):**
    
    - **Definition:**
        - DML is like the storyteller. It adds, updates, or deletes data in the database.
    - **Easy Language:**
        - It's for manipulating or changing data.
8. **Example:**
    
    - Inserting a new student record or updating a phone number.

**Keywords:**

- **INSERT:** Add new data.
- **UPDATE:** Modify existing data.
- **DELETE:** Remove data.

**In a Nutshell:**

- **DDL** is for defining the structure of the database.
- **DQL** is for asking questions and fetching data.
- **DCL** is for managing permissions and access control.
- **DML** is for manipulating or changing data in the database.
