**Declarative Programming:**

1. **Definition:**
    
    - **In Simple Terms:** Declarative programming is like giving a goal or stating what you want, and the system figures out how to achieve it.
    - **Example:** Asking for a cup of coffee without specifying the step-by-step process of making it.
2. **Characteristics:**
    
    - Focuses on what the program should accomplish.
    - Abstracts away the details of how the goal is achieved.
    - Typically more concise and expressive.
3. **Example in Everyday Language:**
    
    - Asking a virtual assistant to "Set a reminder for 3 PM" without specifying how the reminder system works.

**Imperative Programming:**

1. **Definition:**
    
    - **In Simple Terms:** Imperative programming is like giving step-by-step instructions, detailing how to achieve a goal.
    - **Example:** Writing a recipe that explicitly outlines each step to make a sandwich.
2. **Characteristics:**
    
    - Focuses on providing explicit instructions on how to perform a task.
    - Involves a sequence of commands that change a program's state.
    - Often more detailed and prescriptive.
3. **Example in Everyday Language:**
    
    - Giving a friend detailed directions on how to get to your house, including every turn and landmark.

**Comparison:**

- **Declarative Programming:**
    
    - **Focus:** What needs to be done.
    - **Approach:** Higher level of abstraction.
    - **Example:** SQL, HTML.
- **Imperative Programming:**
    
    - **Focus:** How to do it.
    - **Approach:** Lower level of abstraction.
    - **Example:** C, Python.

**In a Nutshell:**

- Declarative programming is like stating what you want, leaving the details to the system.
- Imperative programming is like giving step-by-step instructions on how to achieve a goal.
