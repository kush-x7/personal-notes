**SQL (Structured Query Language):**

1. **Definition:**
    
    - SQL is like a language for talking to databases.
    - It helps us ask questions and get information from databases.
    
2. **Keywords:**
    
    - **SELECT:** Asks the database to show us specific information.
    - **FROM:** Tells the database where to look for the information.
    - **WHERE:** Helps us filter information based on certain conditions.
    - **GROUP BY:** Puts similar information together.
    - **HAVING:** Filters grouped information.
    - **ORDER BY:** Arranges information in a particular order.
    - **JOIN:** Combines information from different places.

```sql
SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students;

SELECT * FROM students;

SELECT first_name, last_name FROM students WHERE age > 20;

SELECT grade, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY grade;

SELECT grade, COUNT(*) FROM students GROUP BY grade HAVING COUNT(*) > 2;

SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY age DESC;

SELECT students.first_name, students.last_name, courses.course_name
FROM students
JOIN courses ON students.id = courses.student_id;

```
    
3. **Example:**
    
    - Imagine you have a database of students.
    - You could use SQL to ask, "Show me the names of all students who are older than 20."
    - It's like asking questions to the database and getting answers that you want.

Remember, SQL is a tool for talking to databases, and these keywords help you ask for the specific information you're interested in.
