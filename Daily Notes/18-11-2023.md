Web-based software engineering refers to the process of developing software applications that are designed to be accessed and used over the internet through a web browser. This approach has become increasingly popular with the rise of web technologies and the shift towards cloud computing. Web-based applications are typically hosted on servers and can be accessed by users from any device with a web browser, as opposed to being installed locally on individual machines.

Here are some key differences between web-based software engineering and the traditional model:
```

1. **Access and Deployment:**
    
    - **Web-Based:** Applications are accessed through a web browser and can be deployed on a central server or cloud platform. Users access the software over the internet.
    - **Traditional:** Software is installed locally on users' devices. Updates and maintenance often require manual intervention on each user's machine.
    
1. **Platform Independence:**
    
    - **Web-Based:** Users can access the application from various devices and operating systems as long as they have a compatible web browser.
    - **Traditional:** Applications are often platform-specific, requiring different versions for different operating systems.
    
1. **Collaboration and Sharing:**
    
    - **Web-Based:** Facilitates collaboration and sharing of data as it is stored centrally. Multiple users can work on the same data simultaneously.
    - **Traditional:** Collaboration might require additional tools or complex setups, and sharing data may involve file transfers.
    
1. **Updates and Maintenance:**
    
    - **Web-Based:** Updates can be applied centrally, ensuring that all users have access to the latest version without individual installations.
    - **Traditional:** Updates often require users to manually download and install new versions.
    
1. **Scalability:**
    
    - **Web-Based:** Easier to scale as the application is hosted centrally. Additional server resources can be allocated to handle increased demand.
    - **Traditional:** Scalability might be more challenging, especially if the application relies on individual machines for processing.
    
1. **Resource Requirements:**
    
    - **Web-Based:** Users need only a compatible web browser, and most of the processing happens on the server side.
    - **Traditional:** Users' machines must meet certain hardware and software requirements for the application to run efficiently.
