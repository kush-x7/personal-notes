## Statically Typed

```java
int x = 5;
String message = "Hello";
```

### 1. **Type Checking at Compile Time:**
 
   - In statically typed languages, variable types are checked at compile time (before the program runs).
   - The compiler enforces strict type rules, ensuring that variable types are compatible and consistent throughout the code.

### 2. **Variable Declarations:**
   
   - Variable types must be explicitly declared before using them.
   - Examples of statically typed languages include Java, C, C++, and Swift.

### 3. **Benefits:** 

   - Early detection of type-related errors during the compilation process.
   - Generally, better performance since the compiler has more information to optimize the code.

## Dynamically Typed


```javascript
let dynamicVar = 42;

dynamicVar = "Now I'm a string!";

dynamicVar = [1, 2, 3];
```


### 1. **Type Checking at Runtime:**

   - In dynamically typed languages, variable types are checked at runtime (while the program is running).
   - Variable types can be determined and changed during program execution.

### 2. **Variable Declarations:**

   - Variable types often do not need to be explicitly declared; they are inferred at runtime.
   - Examples of dynamically typed languages include Python, JavaScript, Ruby, and PHP.

### 3. **Benefits:**
   
   - Greater flexibility as variable types can change dynamically.
   - Shorter development time due to less explicit type-related code.
