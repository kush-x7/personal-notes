In the context of programming and software development, "**robust**" refers to the <mark style="background: #ADD8E6;"> ability of a system to handle errors and unexpected situations gracefully, without crashing or producing incorrect results. </mark> 

A robust program can withstand erroneous input, unexpected conditions, or faults in the system environment, and it can continue to operate reliably.

In the case of Java, being described as a "robust" programming language means that it is designed to create stable and reliable software. Some of the features that contribute to Java's robustness include:

## 1. **Automatic Memory Management (Garbage Collection):** 

- Java automatically handles memory management, preventing issues like memory leaks or accessing invalid memory locations.

## 2. **Exception Handling:** 

- Java has a robust exception-handling mechanism that allows developers to handle errors and exceptional conditions, preventing abrupt termination of the program.

## 3. **Strong Type Checking:** 

- Java is a statically-typed language, which means that type checking is performed at compile-time. This helps catch errors early in the development process.
 
## 4. **Platform Independence:** 

- The "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA) principle of Java ensures that Java programs can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM), promoting consistency across different platforms.


These features collectively contribute to Java's reputation as a robust programming language, making it suitable for building large-scale, reliable applications. The emphasis on error handling and prevention of common programming pitfalls enhances the overall stability and resilience of Java applications.
